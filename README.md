I have continued development on this because it is the most well developed raid addon and is easy to iterate on and add new encounters.

###What is ReStrat?

ReStrat is a boss mod for Wildstar, currently in early development. The goal of ReStrat is to have a framework which allows rapid development of strategical aids, such as timers, ability alerts, and so on for progress raiding. 

/rs help - Get a list of commands

###Notes
- /rs to bring up the options, then can hit the wrench to bring up the window to move the frames. Click enable moving and then Ctrl+Drag the frames to appropriate places.
- There are not many (any?) options availble really. Nothing to resize, turn off parts or modify anything except where the timers show up. I would eventually like to add these QoL features but it isn't a priority currently. If you want to add these please let me know and would love to add them to this branch.

###Goals

ReStrat is an addon which will see primary use in a progress intensive environment, where information on encounters is sparse. As such the main goals of the addon are as follows:

- Provide the ability to create a boss 'profile' with as little interaction with the base game API as possible.
- Provide tools which allow in detail analysis of encounters.
    - This includes the ability to analyze encounter units,  the actions belonging to them, and the auras gained by all      units.
- Minimal aesthetic which makes efficient use of screen space.
- 

##How to setup
- Download it as a zip, right hand column.
- Extract it, it should be in a folder called ReStrat-master. Rename it to ReStrat
- Move to addon folder.
- Make sure it isn't nested in multiple ReStrat-master folders and that it is a single ReStrat folder.
